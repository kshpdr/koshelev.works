**Who am I?**

I am currently studying computer science at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://gatech.edu) as a master's student. My current research interests include *compilers, programming languages, high-performance computing*, and the intersection of these fields with *deep learning*. I completed my bachelor's degree at the [Technical University of Berlin](https://tu.berlin), where my [bachelor thesis focused on heuristics for twin-width](https://koshelev.works/thesis.pdf), an algorithmic graph problem.

‎

**Work Experience**

During my bachelor studies, I had the pleasure of working at [Check24](https://check24.de), the largest comparison portal in Germany, as a Software Engineer. Prior to that, I was involved with the [Fraunhofer Institute](https://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html), the largest applied research organization in Europe.

‎

I'll post here whatever I find interesting. You can find me on other plaforms too. However, I mainly use Telegram and Email. I am creating the biggest [russian-speaking community around the TU Berlin](https://tuberlin.ru). From time to time I contribute to open-source projects that I find interesting."""
