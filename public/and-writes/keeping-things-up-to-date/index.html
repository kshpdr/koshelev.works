        <h1>Keep things up to date</h1>
        <p class="date">February 1, 2026</p>

        <p>I love having a personal website. It's a canvas where I can create and do whatever I want — express and explore myself.</p>

        <p>It all began from <a href="/bratislava.jpg">this picture</a> from Bratislava I believe (which turned out to be quite different than portrayed in Eurotrip; funny enough it was literally a huge bus euro-trip for us as well). I don't remember what came first — domain or this picture — but regardless the website appeared. In the university times I didn't have trouble keeping it up to date. It was a straightforward thing to do — you're hanging out in the Bib (in German <strong>library</strong> — what a beautiful word) doing assignments and quickly push an update, if there is one and you got a second.</p>

        <p>However, after graduating, I had quite a struggle to go and get my website updated. Until recently! Now I just run a bunch of cursor agents laying in my bed to go make changes and deploy stuff for me directly after merge. You might think: <em>"Wow, what a useless waste of compute"</em>. I even might somewhat agree with you — but given that VC still pumps money, I'll keep my privilege of enjoying it for a fraction of a price. After this ends, we'll go and set up OpenClaw for those purposes (or whatever next hyped up agentic environment gonna be there at a time). The most important thing is that now the friction to write whatever I want to write about is almost non-existent — so I can keep staying awake instead of finally going to sleep. I'll go after this one, I promise (you can check commit history and see whether I stuck to it..).</p>
