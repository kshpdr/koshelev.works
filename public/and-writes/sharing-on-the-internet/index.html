        <h1>Sharing on the Internet</h1>
        <p class="date">January 31, 2026</p>

        <p>I feel genuinely weird about sharing on the internet. I even dare to say that we have somewhat toxic relationship.</p>

        <p>As a fifteen year old kid, I loved hanging out online. I was super-duper cautious about sharing anything because back in the day in my online circles it was weird. I kept anonymity as much as I could and, as a hobby of mine, I was trying to find information about other different people. Pure curiosity!</p>

        <p>Time went by, I kinda moved from this approach to somewhat superficial sharing but nothing personal. Then, even more time went by and somehow I felt open enough to be wanting to share <strong>a lot</strong> of things — I wanted my personal website to be some sort of little (re-)collection of me and my life. Evolution of my music taste, my recordings, random sport stats — all meant to be available to a public judgement! I'm glad that I was a bit too lazy to make it all come true.</p>

        <p>But now I'm somewhat confused. From one side, I definitely do not want to share much online — I have a lot of personal stuff going on, as we all do, and this seems to be a little precious thing of mine available to me and very close friends of mine. From the other side, I do want to share <em>some</em> things. I want to write occasionally about whatever random thing came to my mind and post it. Because personally I love lurking around the internet and reading random people's blogs. It also feels somewhat intimate in a way — a lot of times it feels like this page was never opened by anyone else and I'm the first one to read it.</p>

        <p>So shall this be the beginning of posting random things online. I'll re-read it myself in a couple of years and hopefully it's gonna be as intimate as I think.</p>
